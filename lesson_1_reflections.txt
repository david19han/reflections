How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

   It reduced the amount of information and made it easier to see what was wrong.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

    I could view the different changes and judge which ones were necessary and which ones were not.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

    Doing it in Git makes me learn more.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Some version control systems are better suited for programmers who care about the previous versions.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log can show you all the versions while git diff will compare two separate files.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

    I can always revert back to the last best working condition. 

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    when coding and trying bold new changes. it'll be helpful because I have the previous versions already saved.
