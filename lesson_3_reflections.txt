When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  To back up anything as well as allow other users access
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Because you want to see what changes have been made to Git before you update it on your local files. It could be a costly error if you just automatically update.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	a fork is when cloning in github. branches are when alternate timelines need to be created on the master branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	In case the remote master and the local master are different and you want to merge them.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
	Use Google Drive. It would be harder to see what changes my collaborator made, though updates would be automatic and I wouldn't have to worry about saving. 

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
	To allow your collaborator to see the changes before saving them onto the master branch.
